## Coding project from the Udemy Course [the Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap (2020)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap/)
I wrote the code in docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile. The other files were provided by the instructor. This application detects multiple faces using a machine-learning API.

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons Learned
- Next.js
- Code Analysis
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Cookies
- Sessions with JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Conventional Commits

## ðŸ¤” Senior Software Engineer Considerations
- Single Page Applications (SPA) vs Server Side Rendered Applications (SSR)
  - Choose SPA for:
    - Easing load on the servers
    - Snappier user experience if their device's compute power and internet connection is strong enough
  - Choose SSR for:
    - Faster initial loading
    - Optimizing search engine optimization (SEO)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To run this project locally:
1. In your terminal, navigate to the root folder of Front End and run the following commands
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
2. Make sure you have docker installed and running on your computer
3. Run `docker-compose up` ( you may have to run `docker-compose up --build` for the first setup phase)
4. You must add your own API key in the `controllers/image.js` file to connect to Clarifai API. You can grab a Clarifai API key [here](https://www.clarifai.com/)
5. You will also need to update Line 22 in server.js to your client app port (i.e. 3001)
6. Copy and paste the following into your browser of choice: localhost:3001 or whatever number you chose
7. In your terminal, navigate to the root folder of Back End and run the following commands
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

**Important:** if you are getting conflict errors, you should run `docker stop <container name>` that is already running in the background.
**Important:** if you are getting other errors, you should run `docker-compose down` to bring everything down, and start over.

## ðŸ’» Developing
To contribute to this project on your system:
1. In your terminal, navigate to the root folder of this repository and run `npm install`
2. To make commits, run `npm run commit` to ensure your commit follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines

- To access backend's bash:
Run `docker-compose exec smart-brain-api bash`

- To access postgres: (adjust PORT number if needed)
Run  `psql postgres://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/smart-brain`

- To access redis:
Run `docker-compose exec redis redis-cli`

## ðŸ•¹ How to Use
Sign up for an account and paste image urls into the input field. The output is a blue box around the head of person in the image. The blue box signifies the detection of a face.
